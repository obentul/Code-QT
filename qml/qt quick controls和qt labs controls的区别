Qt Quick Controls were originally developed to support desktop platforms, with mobile and embedded support coming shortly afterwards. They have a very broad scope, in that they provide a styling system flexible enough to allow the development of applications that have either a platform-dependent or platform-independent style.
On embedded systems, where the hardware has limited resources, this approach can be inefficient. Qt Labs Controls were designed to solve this problem, using benchmarks to guide the development.
